## General

|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| [BDEnvironmentTyping] | Variant of EnvironmentTyping to accomodate for the distinction between checking and sorting |
| [BDTyping]            | Main description of bidirectional typing, in a "paranoid" way, *ie.* one that does not rely on strong metatheoretic properties to imply undirected typing |
| [BDToPCUIC]           | Proof that bidirectional typing implies undirected typing |
| [BDTypingInduction]   | Traces of older work, not worth looking at (the complete proof of the right induction principle is in [BDTyping]) |
